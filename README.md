## In a nutshell

*SolePostHoc.jl* is dedicated to post-hoc analysis and optimization of symbolic learning models. It provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms for:
- Rule extraction from both symbolic and non-symbolic models
- Rule minimization and optimization
- Model transformation and enhancement
- Interpretability analysis

## Key Features

### Rule Extraction and Model Optimization
- Extraction of comprehensible rules from complex models
- Support for various source models:
  - Decision trees and random forests
  - Black-box models
- A clean Rule extraction interface (`SolePostHoc.extractrules`)
- Implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms:
  - LUMEN (L: Logic-driven U: Unified M: Minimal E: Extractor of N: Notions)
  - InTrees (Interpret Tree Ensembles)
  - BELLATRIX
- have binding with other state-of-the-art algorithms
	- ModalETEL
	- binding to intrees
	- binding to RuleCOSI(+)
  - BATrees (Born Again Trees)
### Through these we guarantee
- Rule minimization techniques
- Model simplification while preserving accuracy
- Performance enhancement through post-processing

### Integration
- Seamless integration with other Sole.jl packages


## Usage Example

```julia
# Load packages
using SolePostHoc
using SoleModels
using MLJ

# Load and prepare a model (e.g., a random forest)
üå≥ = load_model("your_model.jl")

# Extract rules
üçÉ = extractrules(üå≥, method = :LUMEN)

# View metrics
printmetrics(üçÉ)
```
