# ModalAssociationRules.jl

The package is developed by the [ACLAI Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) @ University of Ferrara.

**ModalAssociationRules.jl** lives in the context of [**Sole.jl**](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl), an open-source framework for *symbolic machine learning*, originally designed for machine learning based on modal logics (see [Eduard I. Stan](https://eduardstan.github.io/)'s PhD thesis *"Foundations of Modal Symbolic Learning"* [here](https://www.repository.unipr.it/bitstream/1889/5219/5/main.pdf)).
